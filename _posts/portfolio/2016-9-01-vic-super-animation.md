VicSuper had a very tight deadline to deliver a change management and engagement piece around their new strategy. We developed this motion graphics piece in the space of 8 days. I drew up the boards, produced high-level visuals and animated some of the content. I was directing two freelance animators to get this project across the tight deadline. The client was extremely happy with the outcome.
