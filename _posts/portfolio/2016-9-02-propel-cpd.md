Propel is DeakinPrime’s CPD platform. I’ve been involved in the conception, UX, prototype, design and build phases of this project. The objective of Propel was to develop an easy
to use and simple system to delivery CPD plans and content to  nancial advisers. Through user testing and prototyping I developped an easy to use and intuitive system.
