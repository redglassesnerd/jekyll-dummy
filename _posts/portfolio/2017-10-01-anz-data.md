DeakinCo. was engaged by ANZ to produce a change management and education piece using a blended learning approach. We ran multiple design thinking sessions and surveyed over 100 ANZ staff to come up with a bespoke solution. The solution was focused around a marketing style campaign called <3Data. I was involved in these sessions, helping create on-the-spot paper prototypes and developed the visual approach, charactisation and animations for the <3Data campaign.
